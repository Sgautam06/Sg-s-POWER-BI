Resume Project-Healthcare Dashboard




This healthcare dashboard, built using Power BI, provides an interactive and comprehensive analysis of key metrics in the healthcare domain. It allows users to visualize and monitor patient demographics, hospital performance, and disease incidence across various regions and time periods. The dashboard integrates multiple data sources, such as Excel and SQL databases, ensuring that all insights are up to date with real-time data updates. With visualizations of critical metrics like patient admissions, discharge rates, bed occupancy, and financial data, healthcare professionals can make more informed, data-driven decisions. Additionally, the dashboard offers filtering options for easy exploration of specific data subsets, such as by time period, location, or patient group. It is designed with user-friendliness in mind, offering navigation through different sections for easy data analysis. Future enhancements include the integration of more real-time data sources, predictive analytics for forecasting disease outbreaks or resource shortages, and personalized patient insights. This project can be downloaded and viewed in Power BI Desktop, with an option to refresh the data for the latest updates. Contributions and feedback are welcome for further improvements.
